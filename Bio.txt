Hey there, my name is Haaris Arain. YOu probably know who I am because you showed up to my website! 
But if by some chance you stumbled upon this hidden gem I'll tell you a little bit about my self.
I like to hang out with friends, and learn new things! I spend time usually trying out new stuff.
I love movies! Moving pictures are like the best things to do if you're bored.
I love jews! I do not discriminate against race or religion, here you are safe.
Politics may not be my strong suit but I sure do love to argue and debate.
My close friends know that I like to go by Peter, so congrats on being a close friend!
I like long walks on the beach and love talking, but not all the time.
I am an avid member of the 4th Dominion Church Program of the Blood of Jesus Christ, Praise!
I was born in Mamaw, Kentucky but I was raised with my loving white family in Naperville, Illinois!
I have a little dog named damion, he is a cocker spaniel and loves belly rubs! I also have a Black friend named 
Elijah Bryant, he is quircky dude!
I hope you enjoyed learning a little bit about me, and enjoy yourself on this wicked website I made!
